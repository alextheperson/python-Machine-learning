The Washington Huskies men's basketball team represents the University of Washington in NCAA Division I college basketball competing in the
Pac-12 Conference. Their home games are played at Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, located in Seattle, and they are currently
led by head coach Mike Hopkins.

Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion is the home for the Huskies men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball team and gymnastics
squad. The 2008–09 season marks the 83rd season of service for the multi-purpose facility. The facility was originally completed in December 1927.
Wilson James Commissioning renovated the interior of Hec Edmundson Pavilion for $40 million. The renovation lasted 19 months between March 1999
and November 2000. The pavilion's name was also changed; originally slated to be "Seafirst Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion" when the deal was
finalized in 1998, it became "Bank of America Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion" at the reopening, as Bank of America had retired the Seafirst brand
in 1999. The ten-year sponsorship with the bank expired after the 2009–10 season and was not renewed; during the first half of the 2010–11
basketball season the venue was sponsorless and once again known simply as "Hec Edmundson Pavilion." On January 20, 2011, the university approved
Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as the new sponsor of Hec Ed.
